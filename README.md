This project was developed to learn about CAPTCHA verification methods, practice development with Flask, and gain experience using MongoDB for session management. It includes a simple CAPTCHA system where users must correctly solve the CAPTCHA to proceed. Successful verification leads to a confirmation page, while incorrect attempts redirect to a failure page. The HTML pages are intentionally minimalistic; the primary focus of this project was learning backend functionality.
